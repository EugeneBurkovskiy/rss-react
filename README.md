## RS Clone
This project consists of many branches. Each branch contains the technologies that I used in the process of studying react, redux, jest, cypress and ssr. Below are the sections and indicate the technologies that I used on each branch.
- ### Components Task
First acquaintance with class components in react. Writing the first tests with Jest and RTL.
- ### API Task
Working with API in React using native tools in class components.
- ### Hooks Task
Rewriting class components to functional ones using hooks.
- ### Form Task
Creating, validating a form with react-hook-form.
- ### Redux Task
Using Redux Toolkit for state management and RTKQuery for api requests.
- ### SSR Task
SSR implementation using native react and Nodejs. Using cypress for e2e component testing.
